# KTG's Slime Hutch Interior

I got bored with the regular slime hutch interior, and going in there feels like a chore to me, so I made this to make the interior more fun. 

This map provides more room in the Slime Hutch, an auto-fenced area where you can corral your slimes, and fishing that matches the town's fishing, plus midnight carp from 22:00 to 02:00, and Slimejacks during the day.
